LimeSurvey downgrade tool
==========

Takes an LSS file from LimeSurvey 6, and produces an LSS file that can be imported into LimeSurvey 3

Useful if sharing a survey with someone who is using the LTS version of LimeSurvey

Will not bring across everything, but as much as possible. If it doesn't bring everything you expect - please submit a feature request or bug
